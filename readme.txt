== Description ==

This Wordpress plugin will allow you to easily take control of the wordpress toolbar.

The Wordpress toolbar was introduced in version 3.1 and allows you to have quick links to logged in users on your Wordpress site.

The problem with the Wordpress toolbar is that it comes with a number a default Wordpress links which you will never use like these:
- Wordpress.org
- About Wordpress
- Wordpress Document
- Support Forums
- Feedback
- Site name link
- View site link
- Plugin update link
- Comments link
- New content link
- Wordpress my account link
- Change howdy text

This plugin will allow you to easily remove any of the following links from your toolbar.

The added extra in this plugin is that it allows you to easily add your own links to the toolbar by creating a Wordpress menu
and assigning it to be used in the Wordpress toolbar.

4. Remove the links you don't want to use.
6. Navigate to Appearance -> Menus to create your own Toolbar menu
7. Navigate back to Settings -> Control Wordpress Toolbar and select the menu to use in the Toolbar
